### What I learned

By having the chance to complete this challenge I had learned about sematic HTML, flexbox and problem solving thinking.
Looking to have the accordeon to do what I wanted it to do was very challenging.

### Continued development

In the next projects I'm looking to improve my styling skills as well as my programing logic and problem solving skills with JavaScript
